  <p><a href="http://vocamus.net/dave/">David Humphy</a> from <a href="http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/wiki/index.php/Processing.js">Open Source @ Seneca</a>
  has put together <a href="http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/wiki/index.php/Processing.js#Project_Leader.28s.29">an excellent team of students</a>, who are working on Processing.js as part of 
  Mozilla's <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/Projects/ProcessingForTheWeb">Processing for The Open Web</b> initiative. Among the students are members of 
  <a href="http://cleung.wordpress.com/">Cathy Leung</a>'s C3DL team, who developed the <a href="http://www.c3dl.org/">C3DL JavaScript Library</a> for use with The Canvas3D plugin for Firefox.
  Using this technology they had created, they developed a commercial web-solution, <a href="http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=771">Motion View</a>,
  to assist in the tedious clean-up-operation after a busy day's 3D motion capture.
  <a href="http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=771">Motion View</a> is now being used by companies such as <a href="http://www.bedlamgames.com/">Bedlam Games</a>, who are working the very-cool... <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3173011">Scratch The Ultimate DJ</a>.</p>
