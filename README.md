The Processing.js website
=========================

This is our website, in all it's glory.

Testing the website locally
---------------------------

Install [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Install) on your computer,
clone this repository, and run `jekyll` inside the root of the repository. This will
compile (yes, seriously) the website into the _site directory, and start a localhost
web server running on port 4000. Jekyll will automatically recompile the site if you
make any changes.
