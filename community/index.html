    <p>After its initial release in 2008 by <a href="http://ejohn.org/">John Resig</a>, the
    Processing.js project was picked-up by students in the
    <a href="http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Centre for Development of
    Open Technology</a> at Seneca College. The
    <a href="http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/wiki/index.php/Processing.js">student team</a>
    finished the port of Processing.js, fixing more than 900 bugs, shipping 12 releases,
    and creating a vibrant developer community around Processing.js in the process. This
    project was done through a partnership between the
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/">Mozilla Foundation</a> and
    <a href="http://www.senecacollege.ca/">Seneca College</a>, and was led by
    <a href="http://vocamus.net/dave/">David Humphrey</a>, <a href="http://bocoup.com/">Al
    MacDonald</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/corban">Corban Brook</a>. The students
    continue to maintain the project today.</p>
