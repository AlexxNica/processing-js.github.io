<h3>StatementsComments</h3>



<p>Statements are the elements that make up programs. 

The ";" (semi-colon) symbol is used to end statements.  

It is called the "statement terminator." 

Comments are used for making notes to help people better understand programs. 

A comment begins with two forward slashes ("//").</p>
