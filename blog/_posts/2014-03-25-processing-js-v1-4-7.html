title: Processing.js v1.4.7 released
---
<p>Since our last release, 1.4.1, Processing.js has been given a bit of a source code
overhaul, culminating in a new release: 1.4.7! This release adds in new functionality
that you might already know from Processing 2.0, but was missing in Processing.js such
as new methods in PVector and XML. The release model has also been changed: we're going
to be releasing a new version every time a merge in a patch that either fixes something,
or adds a feature that is still missing. This makes things way easier for us to manage,
and ensures that you don't have to wait months while updates slowly gather dust waiting
for a major release. You can download the new version of Processing.js over on the
<a href="/download">download</a> section, and let us know what's still missing!</p>

<p>As we're reshuffling the source code, some things are currently not available: the
API-only version of Processing.js was so insignificantly smaller than the regular version
that it will no longer be generated. The difference was about 10kb on 200kb, and the
added complexity of compiling an API-only version was simply not something that could be
taken on. If you want to help bring that back, we'd love to talk to you! We're also
not packaging the examples anymore, as a lot of them are actually incredibly out of date
and do not reflect proper Processing.js or even Processing approaches. Again, if you
want to help create a set of useful example again with us, get in touch!</p>
