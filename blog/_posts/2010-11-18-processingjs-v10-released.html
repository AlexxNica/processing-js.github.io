title: Processing.js v1.0 Released
---
<p>This is the one you've been waiting for. The Processing.js team is pleased to announce
the release of <a href="http://processingjs.org/download">Processing.js
version 1.0</a>.  Since its original release by John Resig in 2008, over 1,000 bug fixes,
features, and under-the-hood improvements were made.  The goal of Processing.js is parity
with Processing, ease of use in the web environment, wide compatibility with modern web
browsers, and great performance.  Processing.js is now feature complete with Processing,
with a very few exceptions (see the <a href="http://processingjs.org/reference">Reference
page</a> for details).</p>

<p>This release represents years of work by a very dedicated developer and user community.
With Processing.js we hope to expand the reach of Processing on the web, and bring a new
generation of developers to this wonderful language.  The open web will be a much easier
place to do graphical programming, starting today.</p>

<strong>We're proud of Processing.js and hope you'll enjoy using it as much as we do!</strong>
