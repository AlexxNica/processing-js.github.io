title: Processing.js v1.2.1 Released
---
<p>Hot on the heels of 1.2.0 we're releasing a <a href="http://processingjs.org/download">maintenance
release 1.2.1</a> to address a regression identified by Florian Jenett, relating to the
use of background() with 3 arguments. An associated issue broke the @pjs "transparent"
directive, and we fixed both issues in this maintenance release. We also took the
opportunity to update the gzipped version of processing.js in the release archive, which
was accidentally posted as a 0-byte file. This release is brought to you thanks to
Florian's quick post on our bug tracker, so: if you find issues with Processing.js, don't
hesitate to file a bug with us at 
<a href="https://processing-js.lighthouseapp.com">https://processing-js.lighthouseapp.com</a>
- we hate them just as much as you do.</p>
