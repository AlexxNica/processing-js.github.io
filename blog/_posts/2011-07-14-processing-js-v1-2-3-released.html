title: Processing.js v1.2.3 released
---
<p>The Processing.js team is pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://processingjs.org/download">
Processing.js 1.2.3</a>. This is a maintenance release, which focused primarily on tests,
non-core Processing code, and other things we never have time to do--spring cleaning, if you will.</p>

<p>While we mainly worked around the edges of the core Processing code, there are still
some notable changes and updates for our users. Specifically:</p>

<ol>
	<li>We have removed init.js, and changed the way that inline Processing code gets loaded
by Processing.js. In the past, inline sketches (e.g., those contained within &lt;script
type="text/processing"&gt;...&lt;/script&gt;) were loaded by a helper script called
"init.js". This was confusing for users. Starting with 1.2.3, inline Processing scripts
need to specify the ID of the canvas in which they should be drawn, by specifying this ID
as the value of an attribute called "data-processing-target". For example:
<pre>&lt;script type="text/processing" data-processing-target="targetcanvas"&gt;
  /* processing code here */
&lt;/script&gt;
...
&lt;canvas id="targetcanvas"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;</pre>
While the preferred way to load sketches is using the "data-processing-sources" attribute
on the canvas element instead of doing inline sketches, sometimes using inline code is
desirable, and that's now easier to use. The "example.html" file further demonstrates
several ways of getting your Processing sketches shown on a page.</li>
	<li>We have removed the @pjs "transparent" directive. In the past we used this in order
to give a hint to the canvas that transparency would be happening. Not all browsers
implement this hint, and we decided (after doing performance tests) that the confusion it
caused for users isn't worth keeping it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our next release will be focused on core Processing fixes again, as well as achieving
parity with the upcoming
<a href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/Changes#Upcoming_changes_in_Processing_2.0">Processing
2.0</a> release of our sister project. If you are using Processing.js and notice
compatibility, performance, or other issues, please let us know via
<a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/processing.js">IRC</a> (irc.mozilla.org #processing.js) or
by filing a bug on our
<a href="https://processing-js.lighthouseapp.com/projects/41284-processingjs/overview">bug
tracker</a>.
