<p><a href="http://processingjs.org/download">Download Processing.js 0.9.4</a></p>

<p><strong>We are very pleased to announce the release of Processing.js 0.9.4!</strong></p>

<p>The new 0.9.4 release is now available for <a href="http://github.com/jeresig/processing-js">download</a>
on the GitHub repository. This release features a brand new lightweight parser that improves flexibility.
But thats not all. We have added a lot of 3D features and are NOW supporting textures.  Check out the newly
added crisp @pjs directive for crisp lines and points.  Of course performance is always on the top of our
list, we are proud to say that processing.js is now faster than ever!</p>

<p>Get involved!</p>

<p>If you would like to get involved with Processing.js development, or have general usage questions about
Processing.js, we would love meet you on IRC:
<a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/processing.js">irc://irc.mozilla.org/processing.js</a> You can also get
involved by helping with the testing or documentation phase.</p>

<p><strong>We are desperately seeking help with documentation.</strong></p>
