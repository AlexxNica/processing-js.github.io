<p><strong>We are very pleased to announce the release of Processing.js 0.9.1!</strong></p>

<p>The new 0.9.1 release is now available for <a href="http://github.com/jeresig/processing-js">download</a>
on the GitHub repository. This release is an architectural refactoring of the library to remove a legacy
performance issue. This rewrite will allow modern JavaScript engines to better optimize the libraries code
at runtime. For example, taking advantage of tracing in Firefox's SpiderMonkey engine. Of course, this
release would not be possible without
