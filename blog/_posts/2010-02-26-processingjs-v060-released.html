<p><a href="http://processingjs.org/download">Download Processing.js 0.6</a></p>

<p><strong>We are very pleased to announce the release of Processing.js 0.6!</strong></p>

<p>The students at Seneca and the community at large, have been working hard to get some
awesome code into the repository. Many smaller fixes and features have been added. However,
the most exiting addition is the implementation of 3D functions like sphere, line, fill and
stroke. Also, we have set up OpenGrok to enable easy searching of the Java Processing.</p>
