title: Processing.js v0.5.0 Released

<p><b>We are very pleased to announce the release of Processing.js 0.5!</b></p>

<p>The students at Seneca and the community at large, have been working hard to get some
awesome code into the repository. Many smaller fixes and features have been added. However,
the most exiting addition is the implementation of camera functions and a more complete 3D
foundation that is now able to render and rotate a box.</p>

<h3>Linting</h3>

<p>From 0.4 onwards, release code is being linted, beautified and packed before release
using some excellent script-fu from David Humprey and tested by fellow release controller
(and GitHub master) <a href="http://github.com/corbanbrook/processing-js">Corban Brook.</a>
This way we will be confident that new releases do not break old functionality, code will
be lightweight, ready for deployment and be easier-on-the-eye for future developers.</p>

<h3>Get involved!</h3>
