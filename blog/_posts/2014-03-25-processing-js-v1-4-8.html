title: Processing.js v1.4.8 released
---
<p>It's been a few weeks and PRocessing.js got a few PRs merge in, so it's time for a new
release: say hello to 1.4.8! This version has some fixes to PVector's rotate, support for
randomGaussian(), and several unit tests to make sure those fixes pass muster. You
can download the new version of Processing.js over on the <a href="/download">download</a>
section, and let us know what's still missing!</p>
