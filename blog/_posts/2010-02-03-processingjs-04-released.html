<p><b>We are very pleased to announce the release of Processing.js 0.4!</b></p>

<p>The students at Seneca and the community at large, have been working hard to get some
awesome code into the repository. Many smaller fixes and features have been added as well
as larger functions like blend modes. Another landmark in 0.4, are the small fragments of
OpenGL code that have begun to land. If you were not aware that <b>Processing.js is getting
3D hardware support in the browser</b>, you are now!</p>

<p>The whole development process has taken a few releases to get right, but the community
has gathered great momentum in the last few months and the "right people" have joined the
group, helping Processing.js to run like the well oiled machine it should be. We are seeing
some <b>amazing innovation and creativity from community members</b>, such the experimental
HTML5 <a href="http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=974">audio stream reading and writing</a> in
Firefox from David Humprey and co.</p>

<h4>Development Process</h4>

<b>The GitHub flow has also shifted to a more organized state</b> with <a href="http://annasob.wordpress.com/category/processing-js/">Anna Sobiepanek</a> heading up .NEXT branch control prior to super-review and release candidacy. This allows us to keep the repository clean, so the main branch <a href="http://github.com/jeresig/processing-js">jeresig/processing-js</a> will only get updated when a new release ships. The code will bubble up through controlled channels that have had rigorous tests and checks applied by the community, keeping the library parallel with it's big sister <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a>, while maintaining a degree of difference that makes Processing.js suitable for the web context in which it is deployed.

<h4>Linting</h4>

<p>From 0.4 onwards, release code is being linted, beautified and packed before release
using some excellent script-fu from David Humprey and tested by fellow release controller
(and GitHub master) <a href="http://github.com/corbanbrook/processing-js">Corban Brook.</a>
This way we will be confident that new releases do not break old functionality, code will
be lightweight, ready for deployment and be easier-on-the-eye for future developers.</p>
