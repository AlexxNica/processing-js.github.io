<p><a href="http://processingjs.org/download">Download Processing.js 0.7</a></p>

<p><strong>We are very pleased to announce the release of Processing.js 0.7.1!</strong></p>

<p>The students at Seneca and the community at large, have been working hard to get some
awesome code into the repository. After the release of 0.7 we realized that our implementation
of mouse wheel support actually broke the whole script in  Chrome/Safari. We ask that anyone
that downloaded the 0.7 release upgrade to 0.7.1 as soon as possible.</p>
