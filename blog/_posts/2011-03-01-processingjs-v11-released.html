title: Processing.js v1.1 Released
---
<p>Release 1.1 is <a href="http://processingjs.org/download/">now available
for download</a> and contains a whole host of new features!</p>

<p>Our mission this release was to focus on tightening up on as many bugs as possible but
also to add a large set of new features to the library. Some of the highlights of the new
features for this release are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Support for touch events on iOS devices</li>
	<li>mouseOver and mouseOut events were added to allow events to take place when the user
	enters and leaves a canvas</li>
	<li>A custom pjs packager has been created that can take a sketch and package it together
	with the library, strip out unneeded code, minify it, and create a final .js file that is
	much smaller in size and lightweight</li>
	<li>An option was added to the makefile that allows you to create an API only version of
	processing.js</li>
	<li>Numerous website updates were done to the reference pages and documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>More than 60 other bugs were fixed this release including 3D fixes and a ton of fixes
to our testing platforms making our bug detection process much more efficient.</p>

<p>Our exhibition page has also been updated with some of the newest Processing.js works
