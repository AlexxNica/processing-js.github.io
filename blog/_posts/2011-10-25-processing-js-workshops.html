title: Processing.js Workshops
---
<p>It's conference season, and the Processing.js team has been invited to speak at various
events around the world in the next month.  If you're interested in learning Processing.js,
or want to connect with others who use it, these events are great places to meet the
Processing/Processing.js communities.  Two of Processing.js' lead developers, David Humphrey
and Jon Buckley, will be running these sessions and giving talks.</p>

<p>On <a href="http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2011/node/101">Thursday October 27, 2011 from 9:00am
- 12:00pm</a> we'll be at the <a href="http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2011/">Free Software and
Open Source Symposium (FSOSS)</a> at Seneca College in Toronto (the home of Processing.js!).
This workshop will give an introduction to Processing and Processing.js, and show how to
integrate web technologies (e.g., JavaScript libraries) and data services (e.g., Twitter)
with Processing.js sketches.</p>

<p>From <strong>November 4-6</strong> we'll be in London, UK for the
<a href="https://mozillafestival.org/">Mozilla Media Festival</a>.  We'll be giving a workshop
on Processing.js, and showing how to use HTML5 media technologies, JavaScript libraries, and
mobile device APIs.  Workshop time TBD.</p>

<p>From <strong>November 11-13</strong> we'll be in Chicago for the
<a href="http://ketai.aa.uic.edu/mobileprocessing/">Mobile Processing conference</a>. We'll
be giving a <a href="http://ketai.aa.uic.edu/mobileprocessing/pg/groups/30/david-humphrey-and-jon-buckley-deep-web-integration-with-processingjs/">
workshop</a> on using Processing.js with the web and mobile web, how to make Processing
sketches work on Andorid, iOS, and other mobile platforms, and generally how to leverage
web technologies and data sources in Processing.js. We will also give a 
<a href="http://ketai.aa.uic.edu/mobileprocessing/pg/groups/29/david-humphrey-processingjs-processing-for-the-mobile-web/">
talk</a> on Processing.js generally, and how it can be used with the (mobile) web.</p>

<p>We also see that there is a series of
<a href="http://www.gaffta.org/2011/09/12/creativewebdev-with-processing-js/">Processing.js
workshops going on at GAFFTA</a> on <strong>Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays, October 25th &amp;
27th, November 1st &amp; 3rd</strong>.  If you're in San Francisco, be sure to check these out.</p>

<p>Looking forward to meeting you at one of these events.</p>
