<p><strong>We are very pleased to announce the release of Processing.js 0.8!</strong></p>

<p>The students at Seneca and the community at large, have been working hard to get some
awesome code into the repository. We are proud to announce a full rewrite of p.color which
greatly increases performance. Also included in this release are lightning functions like
spotlight(), ambientLight(), and pointLight(), as well as material properties like
shininess(), and emissive().</p>
